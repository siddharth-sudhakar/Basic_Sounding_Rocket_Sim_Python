# Basic_Sounding_Rocket_Sim_Python
This repository contains a Python-based simulation of a sounding rocket's flight. It models key physical forces such as thrust, drag, and gravity to simulate the rocket's ascent and descent, providing visual insights into altitude, velocity, and acceleration over time.
